# Replication Study: A First Look at Good First Issues on GitHub

A repository containing the tooling used and data produced for my reproduction of experiment methodology and results from Tan et al.'s "A First Look at Good First Issues on GitHub" (2020).

## SQL Workspace

Contact me if you would like access to the dataset of views I created for this study. 

Alternatively, you can access the GHTorrent dataset via  Google BigQuery. Use `data_collection.sql` to create initial views and follow the comments and queries in `rq1.sql` and `rq2.sql`. 

## Resources

* [GHTorrent Google BigQuery](https://t.co/k8Oq1oD8uV?amp=1): Publicly available GHTorrent dump, dated "2019-06-01."

* [GHTorrent Relational Schema](https://ghtorrent.org/relational.html): Useful for interpreting tables and querying them on the GHTorrent dataset.
